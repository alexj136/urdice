# urdice

`urdice` is a little python script to help people play the ancient game of Ur. The game of Ur requires 4 tetrahedral dice, each with a mark on two of the four corners. Thus, a die has a 50% chance of landing with a marked corner facing up, and a %50 chance of not. Such peculiar dice are hard to come by, hence this script.

urdice is in the public domain.
